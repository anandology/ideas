# ideas

Proposals for various project ideas to work on at Pipal Academy.

## Overview

Loosely modelled around the Python's PEP. Each proposal to implement a new project or make sustantial changes to any existing project are listed here. 

Process:

1. Create a github issue with the initial proposal
2. discuss with others in the issue
3. once there is concensus and the details are ironed out, add it as a idea 

## Open Issues

- The name _ideas_ doesn't sound that appropriate. What could be a better one?
