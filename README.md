# Compass

Compass is the repository for discussing proposals for new projects and major features to the existing projects at Pipal Academy.

While this is primarily intended for the developers of Pipal Academy, our work is open and anyone is welcome to participate in the discussions and provide inputs.

## Overview

This repository will have all the proposals, each one as markdown file.

The proposal file will be names as `PXX.md`, where `XX` is the two digit number for the proposal.


The processes is loosely modelled around the Python's PEP. 

If you have a new proposal: 

1. Create a github issue with the initial proposal
2. discuss with others in the issue
3. once there is concensus and the details are ironed out, add it as a proposal

The `index.md` file will containe a list of all the proposals as a table.
